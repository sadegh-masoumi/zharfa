Certainly! Below is an example README content for a FastAPI application that clusters PCA (Principal Component Analysis) data and returns clusters through APIs, including functionality to filter data by latitude and longitude. This template assumes a basic understanding of FastAPI, Python, and clustering algorithms.

# FastAPI PCA Clustering Application

## Overview
This FastAPI application is designed to perform clustering on PCA-transformed data. It provides API endpoints to access the clustered data and to filter it based on latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Features
- **PCA Data Clustering:** Cluster PCA-transformed data using a specified clustering algorithm.
- **API Endpoints:** Retrieve cluster information and details via RESTful endpoints.
- **Geographical Filtering:** Filter data based on latitude and longitude parameters.

## Installation

To set up the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /gene/htree`
  - get all Tree.
- `GET /gene/filter`
json
`{“rectangle”: [x1, y1, x2, y2], “cluster_id”: <cluster_id>}`
  - Filter data.
